# Bite test app requirements

A simple React app, that allows you kinda order food. Uses localstorage to store data, and Context API for data management across the app. 

- The user should be able to view a list of items (we will provide a starter list as json attached)
- The user should be able to view an item
- The user should be able to view a cart
- The user should be able to add an item to their cart
- The user should be able to remove an item from their cart
- The user should be able to increment the quantity of an item
- The user should be able to add more than one of the same item in the cart and not increment quantity
- The user should be able to complete their order
- The order of a user should be stored in a persistent mechanism (db, localstorage, etc)
